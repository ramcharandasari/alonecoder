# Typing_Master
**Project Description**:The Typing Master project is a console-based application designed to help users assess and enhance their typing speed and accuracy. It offers a collection of words from diverse categories, enabling users to type them within a specified time frame. The program measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) and maintains a leaderboard to highlight the top-performing participants.
  
**Project outcomes**:The Typing Master project with JSON integration enhances typing skills, engages users with a competitive leaderboard, and offers real-time feedback. It allows data storage, customization, and potential future expansion, making typing practice engaging and effective, while fostering a sense of competition and learning. Open-source options could attract community contributions for ongoing improvements.

# Rat_in_maze
**project Description**:The Terminal-Based Maze Solver is an educational project designed to generate mazes and provide a platform for solving them using Dijkstra's algorithm. This project allows users to interact with mazes in a terminal environment, providing a hands-on experience for maze generation and exploration of the Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding.
                                                               
**Project outcomes**:
The project outcome is a terminal-based maze-solving experience that allows users to:
       1.Generate mazes with customizable size and wall density.
       2.Visualize the randomly generated maze with walls and open spaces.
       3.Solve the maze using Dijkstra's algorithm, displaying a solution path if one exists.
       4.The project aims to provide an interactive and educational platform for maze generation and pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm in a text-based terminal environment.
